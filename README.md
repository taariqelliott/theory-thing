Welcome to Theory Thing!

This is a tool that will help musicians figure out the basic chords for a particular key. 
You will also be able to hear these chords by pressing the number keys 1 through 7 representing that particular chord in the key.

For example, if you select C Major as the key with basic triads:

1. Pressing "1" will play - C Major (I): C - E - G

2. Pressing "2" will play - D Minor (ii): D - F - A

3. Pressing "3" will play - E Minor (iii): E - G - B

4. Pressing "4" will play - F Major (IV): F - A - C

5. Pressing "5" will play - G Major (V): G - B - D

6. Pressing "6" will play - A Minor (vi): A - C - E
