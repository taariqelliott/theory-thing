# THEORY THING

Welcome to Theory Thing!

This is a tool that will help musicians figure out the basic chords for a particular key. 
You will also be able to hear these chords by pressing the number keys 1 through 7 representing that particular chord in the key.

For example, if you select "C" & "major" for the scale:

1. Pressing "1" will play - C Major (I): C - E - G - B

2. Pressing "2" will play - D Minor (ii): D - F - A - C

3. Pressing "3" will play - E Minor (iii): E - G - B - D

4. Pressing "4" will play - F Major (IV): F - A - C - E

5. Pressing "5" will play - G Major (V): G - B - D - F

6. Pressing "6" will play - A Minor (vi): A - C - E - G

7. Pressing "7" will play - B Diminished (viiÂ°): B - D - F - A
